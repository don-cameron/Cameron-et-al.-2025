The code shared here corresponds to the manuscript "MYC modulates TOP2A diffusion to promote substrate detection and activity", 
currently under review with the preprint available on Biorxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.15.665031v1

Pixel correlation
This code enables the plotting of intensity correlation between two images, used in Extended Data Fig. 1a of the Biorxiv manuscript. 

STED_analysis
This code enables the sub-pixel detection of puncta from one channel within a mask region based on another channel (or the same channel). 
It then measures and visualize the signal of another channel around those puncta. This analysis corresponds to Fig. 1c, 2i,j, and Extended
Data Fig. 1b, 3a.
